~a different version of yan hill net~

this is my second iteration of yan hill net. working on mobile responsiveness
with flex/grid, loading and styling webfonts, and generally setting up my 
gallery/art presentation design.

in this version i am:
-expanding my OC's reference pages
-putting up a few illustrations
-adding graphic design elements like logos and stylized webfonts
-adding an intro/preview page for future story

this repo will not include my images
